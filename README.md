**"AI Dungeon Master"**

- **Frontend:** React (interactive RPG UI with chat-style gameplay)  (Work In Progress)

3. **Battle System:** AI decides enemy actions based on player choices.  (Coming Soon)
4. **Random Events:** AI introduces surprise challenges based on the story.  (Coming Soon)

### **Why This is Fun?**  
- Every adventure is **unique**â€”no two players will have the same experience.
